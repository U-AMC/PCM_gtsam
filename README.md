# PCM_gtsam
Visual representation and example of pairwise consistency maximization of factor-graph (Pose-graph). Utilizes Networkx, GTSAM, python for optimization.
PCM requires several assumption and metric to determine 
if two inter-robot measurement **z**<sub>ik</sub><sup>ab</sup> and **z**<sub>jl</sub><sup>ab</sup> are pairwise consistent
Covariance function of inter-robot loop-pair is defined as following:
<p align="center">
$\mathcal{C} \left( \mathbf{z}_{ik}^{ab}, \mathbf{z}_{jl}^{ab} \right) = \left\lVert \left( \ominus \mathbf{z}_{ik}^{ab} \right) \oplus \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{ij}^{a} \oplus \mathbf{z}_{jl}^{ab} \oplus \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{lk}^{b} \right\rVert_{\Sigma} \triangleq \left\lVert \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{ikjl} \right\rVert_{\Sigma_{ikjl}}$
</p>

### Initial Step
We generate a set of pose-graph of two adjacent robot that intersect each other in SE(3).

Each robot is denoted as Robot1 and Robot2, as figure shows. 

Red-dotted lines are false-positive loop pair, and Green-dotted lines show true-positive loop pair. Each inter-robot measurement is generated by function which simulates actual behavior that is likely to occur in Loop-Detection (via Place-Recognition).

### Adjacency matrix and Consistency Graph Generation
The generated loop-pair now is appended into loop_queue, which does not distinctly sort the true or false positivity.
Here we designate a threshold that determines rather the consistency is over or under threshold. The error metric is defined from the beginning, which is a mahalanobis distance defined as a covariance function.
By comparing the consistency, we append the binary value to the adjacency matrix considering pairwise information and error, respectively. 
(adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of nodes are adjacent or connected)
This repository only checks the upper triangular part of the pcm_matrix.

With the loop pair between inter robot, the covariance propagation iteratively occurs due to optimization.

Update version with symforce

Cross-check if this concept is right
